The Galactic Energy Council needs you to solve a potential energy crisis on your homeworld. The last of the servers
running the old energy exchange is about to fail in 24 hours, and you have been chosen to implement a replacement.

Your main goal is to implement a new energy exchange in this limited time. That is, a service which can be used by the
traders of your planet to buy and sell energy. Without it, a blackout and total chaos on your planet is inevitable.

You may use any technologies from any planet, but the service must be submitted as a Docker image. This
requirement should prevent the issue which caused this situation in the first place - servers dying and nobody being
able to redeploy the exchange.
